# Odour Taxonomies XML Schema

This Git repository contains the XML Schema definition for odour taxonomies that can be used to standardize and promote interoperability of citizen observatories and other applications that use databases of odours.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a standardized and well-defined structure for odour-related data, allowing different systems and applications to exchange and process data using the same format. This can help ensure consistency, accuracy, and interoperability of odour-related information across different platforms and applications.

## Contents

This repository contains the following files:

- `odour_taxonomy.xsd`: The XML Schema definition file that defines the structure and rules for the odour taxonomy.

## Usage
